			<h3>Argument:</h3> <p>A value passed to a function when it is called.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Block:</h3> <p>Sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces.</p>

		<h3>Buffer:</h3> <p>A region of storage used to hold data. IO facilities often store input (or output) in a buffer and read or write the buffer independently of actions in the program. Output buffers usually must be explicitly flushed to force the buffer to be written. By default, reading cin flushes cout; cout is also flushed when the program ends normally.</p>

		<h3>Data Structure:</h3> <p>A logical grouping of data and operations on that data.</p>
		<h3>Edit-compile-debug:</h3><p> The process of getting a program to execute properly.</p>

		<h3>End-of-file:</h3> <p>System-specific marker in a file that indicates that there is no more input in the file.</p>

		<h3>Expression:</h3> <p>The smallest unit of computation. An expression consists of one or more operands and usually an operator.</p>
